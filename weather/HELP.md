#########--How to Use--######
Make sure you set "spring.profile.active" is "dev" to get the config from application-dev.properties. However, you still can set profile to the one you want and remember to add config to the corresponding application properties.
And then update config username and password in properties file to your local Mysql account

if you don't want table to be auto generated then set "spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto" to none and run script.sql

For API Documentation,you can go to localhost:8500/swagger-ui.html for all informations
